## Summary

Cosmic Ascension is a single player, platformer video game. The player controls a spaceship, that has the ability to move side to side and jump. The objective of the game is to make it as far from Earth (the bottom) as possible before the spaceship runs out of a minute's worth of fuel. If the character falls off a platform or falls of the intended path of travel, they have ended their mission and have to start again. There are 3 difficulties for players to choose from, easy, medium, and hard. These are dictated by distance between the platforms. The controls for the ship are are:

`Left arrow = Move left`
`Right arrow = Move right`
`Space bar = Jump`
