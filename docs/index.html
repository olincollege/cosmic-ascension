    <h1>Cosmic Ascension Video Game</h1>
        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
            <p>
                The goal of this project is to create an interactive program using the Python coding language and the Model-View-Controller design pattern.
                We created a single player, platformer video game. The player controls a spaceship, with the objective to make it as far from Earth 
                (the bottom) as possible. If the character falls off a platform, they have ended their mission and have to start again. 
                There are 3 difficulties for players to choose from, easy, medium, and hard. These are dictated by distance between 
                the platforms.
            </p>
