Cosmic Ascension Video Game
===========================

Project Summary
---------------

The goal of this project is to create an interactive program using the Python coding language and the Model-View-Controller design pattern. We created a single player, platformer video game. The player controls a spaceship, with the objective to make it as far from Earth (the bottom) as possible with what fuel they have (simulated by a time limit). If the character falls off a platform, they have failed their mission and have to start again. There are 3 difficulties for players to choose from, easy, medium, and hard. These are dictated by distance between the platforms.
